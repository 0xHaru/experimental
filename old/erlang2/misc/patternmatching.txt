example(N) ->
    receive
        {example, N} ->
            % Do stuff...
        {example, Any} ->
        	% Do other stuff...
    end.

The second occurence of N won't shadow the previous one, the first match will succeed for example if I call example(10) and send a message like {example, 10}.

This is not a bit confusing though and there's a better way of doing it using guards:

example(N) ->
    receive
        {example, M} when M =:= N ->
            % Do stuff...
        {example, M} ->
        	% Do other stuff...
    end.
