TLDR: ; = OR    |   , = AND

A guard sequence is either a single guard or a series of guards, separated by
semicolons (;). The guard sequence G1; G2; ...; Gn is true if at least one of the
guards G1, G2, ... evaluates to true.

A guard is a series of guard expressions, separated by commas (,). The guard
GuardExpr1, GuardExpr2, ..., GuardExprN is true if all the guard expressions GuardExpr1,
GuardExpr2, ... evaluate to true.

...

In addition, guards cannot call user-defined functions, since we want to
guarantee that they are side effect free and terminate.
