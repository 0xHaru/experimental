TLDR: Always use =:= (instead of ==)

You should also be really careful about using == (especially if you’re a C or
Java programmer). In 99 out of 100 cases, you should be using =:=. == is
useful only when comparing floats with integers. =:= is for testing whether
two terms are identical.

Identical means having the same value (like the Common Lisp EQUAL). Since
values are immutable, this does not imply any notion of pointer identity. If
in doubt, use =:=, and be suspicious if you see ==. Note that a similar comment
applies to using /= and =/=, where /= means “not equal to” and =/= means “not
identical.”

Note: In a lot of library and published code, you’ll see == used when the
operator should have been =:=. Fortunately, this kind of error does not often
result in an incorrect program, since if the arguments to == do not contain
any floats, then the behaviors of the two operators are the same.
