Erlang macros are written as shown here:

-define(Constant, Replacement).
-define(Func(Var1, Var2,.., Var), Replacement).

Macros are expanded by the Erlang preprocessor epp when an expression of
the form ?MacroName is encountered. Variables occurring in the macro definition
match complete forms in the corresponding site of the macro call.

-define(macro1(X, Y), {a, X, Y}).

foo(A) ->
    ?macro1(A+10, b)

That expands into this:

foo(A) ->
    {a,A+10,b}.

In addition, a number of predefined macros provide information about the
current module. They are as follows:

• ?FILE expands to the current filename
• ?MODULE expands to the current module name
• ?LINE expands to the current line number
